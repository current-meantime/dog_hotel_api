## loggin, datetime, databases

The logs indicate that the scheduler is working correctly, and the `scheduled_update` function is being triggered every 10 seconds. However, the issue lies in the SQL query executed in the `update_dog_ages` function. Specifically, the error:

`(sqlite3.OperationalError) no such function: timezone`

This happens because SQLite does not support the timezone function, which is being used in the query:

```
SELECT dogs.id, dogs.name, dogs.age, dogs.medicine, dogs.food, dogs.notes, dogs.owner_id, dogs.created_at 
FROM dogs 
WHERE timezone(?, dogs.created_at) <= ?
```

Fix for the `timezone` Issue
SQLite does not have built-in support for time zones. To fix this, you need to adjust your query to work without the timezone function. Instead, you can use Python to handle the time zone conversion before executing the query.

Updated `update_dog_ages` Function:
```
def update_dog_ages(db: Session):
    try:
        logger.info("Starting dog age update process.")
        one_year_ago = datetime.now(timezone.utc) - timedelta(minutes=1)  # Adjusted for debugging
        logger.info(f"Fetching dogs added before: {one_year_ago}")

        # Adjust the query to compare directly with UTC timestamps
        dogs_to_update = db.execute(
            select(Dog).where(Dog.created_at <= one_year_ago)
        ).scalars().all()

        logger.info(f"Found {len(dogs_to_update)} dogs to update.")

        for dog in dogs_to_update:
            dog.age += 1

        db.commit()
        logger.info("Database commit successful.")
        logger.info(f"Successfully updated ages for {len(dogs_to_update)} dogs.")
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Error while updating dog ages: {str(e)}")
```

Explanation of Changes:
1. Removed timezone Function:

The timezone function was removed from the query because SQLite does not support it.
Instead, the comparison is done directly with the one_year_ago UTC timestamp.
Ensure `created_at` is in UTC:

2. Ensure that the `created_at` column in your database is stored in UTC. If it's not, you may need to normalize it to UTC when saving data.

3. Adjusted Debugging Interval:

The `timedelta(minutes=1)` is used for debugging purposes. You can revert it to `timedelta(days=365)` for production.

Additional Notes:
* If you need to handle time zones more robustly, consider using a database like PostgreSQL, which has better support for time zones.
* Ensure that all timestamps in your database are stored in UTC to avoid inconsistencies.

After making these changes, restart your application and check the logs again. The OperationalError should no longer occur, and the logs should confirm that the dog ages are being updated successfully.
